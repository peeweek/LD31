//    THROUGH THE WINDOWS REVISED EDITION CHANGELOG   //
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Version 1.1:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Bug Fixes:
==========
 *  MAJOR COLLISION FUNCTION OVERHAUL : now does not stuck the player to the wall, but instead allows gliding but reduces its velocity. Does not stuck the enemies anymore.
 *  Fixed the West & South Exit Triggers incorrectly placed, and that allowed the player to incorrectly exit the room.

Improvements / Balancing:
=========================

 *  Limited Enemy Spawns on small rooms (5) or Corridors (3)
 *  Limited Enemy Spawn too close to the player's entrance to the room (90px)
 *  Added Random wall blocks inside big rooms
 *  Removed Enemy/Pickup Spawns on the first room.
 *  HUD Cleanup
 *  Set the Start screen to Revised Edition in order to dissociate from the compo edition.
 *  Troll-Factor now increases monster speed by 12% per second until reaching 3x initial speed.
