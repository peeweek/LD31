Through the windows is my first attempt as a game that can run on a single screen. The base idea was to use the same window to display only one room of a dungeon at a time. When exiting the room, a new one is generated, the difficulty meter incremented, and the previous room trashed away, so when you exit from where you entered : SURPRISE ! :)

This was done so in order to create anguish when travelling into the next room. Also, the layout of the rooms are depending of the main screen layout. When travelling to rooms close to screen border you can expect to come to smaller or tightier rooms.

The main objective is to gather 5 crystals that appear randomly around dungeon rooms, at a slightly higher probabiliy as the game advances. Also, there are probabilities to pick up hearts that fill the health meter.

The game is hard and can be frustrating at first, especially because of the collision constraint that require a good alignment, and not rushing for the room exits.
